**Key Visuals:**
- ðŸ“Œ **Overall Churn Rate**: 26.4% churn across 7043 customers.
- ðŸ“Š **Monthly Charges vs Churn**: Higher monthly charges correlate with churn risk.
- ðŸ“‰ **Churn by Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn.
- ðŸ§  **Key Influencer Visual**: Identifies top churn contributors like contract type and internet service.
- ðŸŒ² **Decomposition Tree**: Visual drill-down into features like payment method, gender, and service type.
- ðŸ”— **Churn by Payment Method**: Mailed check and electronic check users show higher churn.
- ðŸ“¶ **Internet Service vs Churn**: Fiber optic customers churn more than DSL and non-users.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Monthly Charges vs Tenure**: Customers with longer tenure tend to have lower churn.

## Machine Learning

A logistic regression model was built to predict churn using:
- Demographics (gender, senior citizen)
- Tenure, monthly charges
- Internet service, contract type, etc.

**Top Features (by importance):**
- Contract Type
- Tenure
- Monthly Charges
- Internet Service

##  How to Run

### Power BI Dashboard
1. Open `churn_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
2. Interact with filters (contract, gender, payment method).
3. Explore decomposition tree and key influencers.

### Python Environment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telecom-customer-churn.git
cd telecom-customer-churn

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the model
python churn_prediction.py
